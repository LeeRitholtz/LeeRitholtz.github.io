	<h1>Hi there!</h1>

	<p">My name is Lee Ritholtz and I work in robotics both professionally and for fun.</p>	
	<p>Most of my work has been focused on aerial applications, so I decided to start a <a href="https://leeritholtz.com/blog">blog</a> documenting, in detail, my ground robotics projects.</p>
	<p>I'm also obscenely into coffee and have something in the works for that as well.</p>
