	<h1>Hi there!</h1>
	<img src="assets/lee.jpg" alt="Lee" style="float:left;width:255px;height:300px;padding-right:50px;">
	<p>My name is Lee Ritholtz and I work in robotics both professionally and for fun.</p>	
	<p>Most of my work has been focused on aerial applications, so I decided to start a <a href="https://leeritholtz.com/blog">blog</a> documenting, in detail, my autonomous rover side projects.</p>
	<p>I'm also obscenely into coffee and have something in the works for that as well.</p>
